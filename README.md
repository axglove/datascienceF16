***COURSE OUTLINE***

Each class will be an engaging, interactive session where we build tools together to make predictions about our data. The classes will be focused on actually building the predictive tools; however, each class will have supplementary lecture notes that describe the methodologies in further detail and extra programming tasks if anyone wants extra practice.
